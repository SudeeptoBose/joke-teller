# joke-teller

Quite the challenge with understanding this one. Functionally, two API's are being used here. 
The first one is a free [joke API](https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/) which retrieves the JSON data and feeds it into a Text-to-Speech API. I chose a Text-to-Speech API from [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/collection/best-text-to-speech-apis)
